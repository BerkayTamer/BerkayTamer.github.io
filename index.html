<h1>Why Vegan?</h1>

<p>Why everyone who cares about animals, health or environment should go vegan? I shared some great videos, documentaries and scientific resources below that will explain why:</p>

<p>This is without a doubt the best documentary that anyone can ever watch when it comes to health. The name of the documentary is Forks over Knives and it involves the world's most largest comprehensive dietary scientific study ever undertaken, The China Study, based on a meta-analysis of the relationship between consumption of animal products and the risk of developing disease which followed 100.000 people over 27 years. This study is conducted under the auspices of Oxford University, Cornell University and the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, a study described by The New York Times as “The Grand Prix of epidemiology.”  and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called this doc “a film that can save your life.” After the study was over, medical doctor T. Colin Campbell, PhD. concluded that people who eat a whole foods, plant-based diet—excluding all animal products—can avoid, reduce, and in many cases reverse the development of numerous illnesses, including most of the leading fatal Western diseases. His report also examines the source of nutritional confusion produced by powerful lobbies, government entities, and opportunistic scientists. If you really care about your health and want to see the findings of the biggest scientific study on human diet, then please watch this documentary and see it for yourself.

<p>After watching the documentary above, I am sure you would be interested to know more about the lies that are being told to us. When you type "The best speech you will ever hear" to youtube, there is this one speech that comes up everywhere and there is a really good reason behind that. This life-changing speech has been translated into 37 different languages with over 10 million YouTube hits because of its awesomeness. Yourofsky (www.adaptt.org) has given 2,660 lectures to more than 60,000 people at 186 schools in 30 states and several Israeli cities and schools. His speech is so effective that it was the reason for nearly 15% of Israel's population embracing the veg lifestyle! Listen to this amazing speaker who will blow away the myths about veganism and fill your mind with interesting facts. He is a huge inspiration and a purveyor of logic, truth and compassion. And his charismatic straightforward style is one-of-a-kind. Please watch this speech at least once in your life because there is no doubt that you will start to question a lot of the things that you believe to be true.
